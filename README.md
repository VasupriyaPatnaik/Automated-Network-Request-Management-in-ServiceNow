## Project Overview
The **Automated Network Request Management in ServiceNow** project focuses on improving efficiency and transparency in handling network-related service requests. By leveraging ServiceNow’s capabilities, the system eliminates manual bottlenecks and ensures requests are processed quickly and accurately.  

End users can submit requests via a self-service portal, while automated routing, approvals, and task assignments streamline fulfillment. Integration with network automation tools allows certain requests to be executed end-to-end without human intervention, resulting in:

- Faster turnaround times  
- Improved SLA compliance  
- Enhanced visibility for users and IT teams
